This work is expected to be used as a supplementary material for Weatherwax and
Epstein's solution manual~\cite{weatherwax2013solution}, which I found to be
very helpful when self-studying this popular textbook. The numbering of chapters
and problems are based on the 2nd edition (10th printing with corrections, Jan 2013) available
online~\cite{friedman2009elements}.

The author was not able to solve all the excercises. Even for the solutions
included we expect many mistakes and shortcomings. It would be of great help if
people could suggest possible solutions or help us find and correct the errors
so this solution manual can be continuously improved to benefit more interested
readers. We are also open to all comments and criticisms. Our contact
information can be found at the website holding this draft~\cite{wu2016partial}.
